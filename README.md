## The Problem: Is there a path through a maze starting and ending at a designated point.
## Recursive Abstraction: When I am asked if there is there a path through a maze starting and ending at a designated point, the recursive abstraction can find if there is a path through a maze starting at a point one step further than the current point and ending at a designated point.
